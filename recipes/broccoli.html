    <h3>This easy roasted broccoli is easy to
         make and will satisfy even the pickiest eaters. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 
            1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a 
            bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, 
            about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While this recipe works best with fresh florets, you can technically 
        make it with frozen broccoli. Don't thaw the broccoli at all before 
        roasting, just stick it in the oven straight from the freezer.</p>
